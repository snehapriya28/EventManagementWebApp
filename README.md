# EventManagementWebApp
Main Idea Description
We have thought of creating a web application which helps the disaster-affected people recover psychologically from trauma by becoming a medium to conduct sessions at a nearby place by trained and certified psychologists who are willing to volunteer to contribute in some manner. We do so by inviting applications from the psychologists/speakers through our app. Then, as soon as speaker verification is done, an event page is created to notify people of the session. People register themselves and if there is sufficient amount of participation, a venue can be decided where this session can be held. This will completely be a community driven initiative where we are providing a platform for event set-up, scheduling and notifying. We also aim to record the sessions and host them on our app for future use. Also, if people find sessions really helpful, they can donate to the speaker through our money transfer service.

Features
Community Driven Sessions

Donation

Blog Space
A blog writing forum/space for people to express their views/ share their experiences on how they tackled the disaster or what went wrong from . This will also help them recover faster and better and be helpful for other people.

Feedback/Experience of Disaster-affected people
A timely and thoughtful evaluation process is essential in determining what worked versus what did not, so that future revisions and enhancements to the disaster plan and response system can be made. So, it is important to take the feedback from disaster-affected people regarding the failure to implement any phase of the disaster management process so that loss of life can be minimized as much as possible in the future.
